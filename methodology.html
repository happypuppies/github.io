        <h2>Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing</h2>
    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>High resolution elevation data is expensive or incomplete.</li>
            <img src="images/HighResDataFootprints.jpg" alt="footprint of high res elevation data not covering Area of Interest">
            <p>Footprints of high resolution data from NRCAN do not cover the Area Of Interest (yellow polygon).</p>
            <li>High resolution aerial imagery data for model verificatin was also hard to find.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ontario GeoHub provided great elevation data in their Ontario Integrated Hydrology dataset,
            as well as cold water data in their Aquatic Resource Area data.</li>
            <img src="images/OIHdata.jpg" alt="Ontario Integrated Hydrology Data web interface view">
            <p>Ontario GeoHub was our best source of data, with elevation data used from Ontario Integrated Hydrology (OIH).</p>
            <li>South Central Ontario Orthophotography (SCOOP) 2018 high resolution imagery tiles were provided by the NCC for model verification.</li>
            <img src="images/SCOOPimages.jpg" alt="SCOOP 2018 high res tiles">
            <p>One of seven SCOOP 2018 tiles provided by NCC.</p>
            <li>Data was extracted by mask to the Area Of Interest and Projected to NAD 83 Ontario MNR Lambert.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Higher resolution elevation data would yield more reliable results.  NRCAN Geogratis data 
            has a resource with 1 metre elevation data but it is not currently complete over the Area Of Interest but this 
            data set could be revisited at a later date to update the model created in this study.</li>

        <h2>Phase 2: Spatial Analysis</h2>
    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Though we had hoped to include our Trace Downstream and Trace Upstream tools in the delivered Experience
            it was found that the NCC AGOL account does not allow the use of trace networks, and no way was found to
            replicate this functionality with the tools available, so it was left as desktop only.</li>
            <li>Deciding on a stream threshold value to determine what level of flow accumulation would constitute a "headwater"
            in this study was difficult to base off existing literature, as it was found to be either too complex (requiring
            data on soil composition and vegetation - all outside the scope of this study) or too simplistic (using a default value
            of 1% of the total catchment outlfow, which for this study would only mirror existing stream data and not include
            surface runoff direction/ephemeral stream creation)
            </li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The final model created used the Enhanced Flow Direction Grid(EFDIR) from Ontario Integrated Hydrology data 
            with tools from the Arc Hydro tool set imported into ArcGIS Pro 2.7 to construct a stream layer with a threshold value
            of 150.</li>
            <img src="images/EFDIRarchydroModelImage.jpg" alt="ArcGIS Pro Model to construct streams from EFDRI with Arc Hydro tools">
            <p>Model used to construct streams in the Area Of Interest</p>
            <li>Inputs were set to parameters to allow the user to quickly reset inputs and stream threshold so many combinations could
            be easily created and compared for analysis.</li>
            <li>After examining many possible stream threshold value from the various combinations of DEM or EFDIR input and built-in 
            hydrology tools or Arc Hydro tools, the final model was chosen.</li>

            <p>Clip of spreadsheet used to track combinations of input data, toolset used and stream threshold.</p>
            <li>The top selected models were shared with the NCC and discussed to settle on the final model from the EFDIR data using 
            Arc Hydro tools with a stream threshold of 150.  THough it is known that this creates Strahler Order 1 streams that are 
            ephemeral, this was preferred by the client.</li>
            <li>Aquatic Resource Area data was incorporated with stream model data to a stream segments layer that contains only segments 
            in areas designated as cold water.</li>
            <img src="images/coldwatersegmentsexample.jpg" alt="Cold water segments shown against all streams in Great Trent area">
            <p>Cold water segments shown against all streams show important fish habitats.</p>

        <h3 class="title-left">Recommendations</h3>

            <li>Dedicated more time to learning Exprience Builder</li>

        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Showing stream interconnectivity was difficult to do using the configurable widgets</li>
            <li>Group editing was not possible on Experience Builder (group members could not be editing the same Web Experience at once)</li>
            <li>Dynamic text is difficult to link to the appropriate data source</li>
            <li>Using views was difficult, but were required to overcome challenges of widgets re-setting initial view</li>
            <li>Difficulty in distinguishing format options between Maps, Views, and Pages</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Created multiple prototype proof-of-concept Experiences utilizing different widgets to display different properties

        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Default template contained a lot of features that were not necessary (subtractive rather than additive templates)</li>
            <li>Challenging to change page formatting</li>
            <li>Easy to lose changes when switching to Preview Mode</li>

        <h3 class="title-left">Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ArcGIS Hub is a viable option for combining static and dynamic ESRI content (Web Maps, Experiences) in a 
                presentation-ready format</li>
