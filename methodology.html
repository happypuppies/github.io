        <h2>Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing</h2>
    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>High resolution elevation data is expensive or incomplete.</li>
            <img src="images/HighResDataFootprints.jpg" alt="footprint of high res elevation data not covering Area of Interest">
            <p>Footprints of high resolution data from NRCAN do not cover the Area Of Interest (yellow polygon).</p>
            <li>High resolution aerial imagery data for model verificatin was also hard to find.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ontario GeoHub provided great elevation data in their Ontario Integrated Hydrology dataset,
            as well as cold water data in their Aquatic Resource Area data.</li>
            <img src="images/OIHdata.jpg" alt="Ontario Integrated Hydrology Data web interface view">
            <p>Ontario GeoHub was our best source of data, with elevation data used from Ontario Integrated Hydrology (OIH).</p>
            <li>South Central Ontario Orthophotography (SCOOP) 2018 high resolution imagery tiles were provided by the NCC for model verification.</li>
            <img src="images/SCOOPimages.jpg" alt="SCOOP 2018 high res tiles">
            <p>One of seven SCOOP 2018 tiles provided by NCC.</p>
            <li>Data was extracted by mask to the Area Of Interest and Projected to NAD 83 Ontario MNR Lambert.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Higher resolution elevation data would yield more reliable results.  NRCAN Geogratis data 
            has a resource with 1 metre elevation data but it is not currently complete over the Area Of Interest but this 
            data set could be revisited at a later date to update the model created in this study.</li>

        <h2>Phase 2: Spatial Analysis</h2>
    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Though we had hoped to include our Trace Downstream and Trace Upstream tools in the delivered Experience
            it was found that the NCC AGOL account does not allow the use of trace networks, and no way was found to
            replicate this functionality with the tools available, so it was left as desktop only.</li>
            <li>Deciding on a stream threshold value to determine what level of flow accumulation would constitute a "headwater"
            in this study was difficult to base off existing literature, as it was found to be either too complex (requiring
            data on soil composition and vegetation - all outside the scope of this study) or too simplistic (using a default value
            of 1% of the total catchment outlfow, which for this study would only mirror existing stream data and not include
            surface runoff direction/ephemeral stream creation)
            </li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The final model created used the Enhanced Flow Direction Grid(EFDIR) from Ontario Integrated Hydrology data 
            with tools from the Arc Hydro tool set imported into ArcGIS Pro 2.7 to construct a stream layer with a threshold value
            of 150.</li>
            <img src="images/EFDIRarchydroModelImage.jpg" alt="ArcGIS Pro Model to construct streams from EFDRI with Arc Hydro tools">
            <p>Model used to construct streams in the Area Of Interest</p>
            <li>Inputs were set to parameters to allow the user to quickly reset inputs and stream threshold so many combinations could
            be easily created and compared for analysis.</li>
            <li>After examining many possible stream threshold value from the various combinations of DEM or EFDIR input and built-in 
            hydrology tools or Arc Hydro tools, the final model was chosen.</li>
            <img src="images/StreamThresholdTestsSpreadsheetImage.jpg" alt="Spreadsheet of inputs and stream thresholds test in models">
            <p>Clip of spreadsheet used to track combinations of input data, toolset used and stream threshold.</p>
            <li>The top selected models were shared with the NCC and discussed to settle on the final model from the EFDIR data using 
            Arc Hydro tools with a stream threshold of 150.  THough it is known that this creates Strahler Order 1 streams that are 
            ephemeral, this was preferred by the client.</li>
            <li>Aquatic Resource Area data was incorporated with stream model data to a stream segments layer that contains only segments 
            in areas designated as cold water.</li>
            <img src="images/coldwatersegmentsexample.jpg" alt="Cold water segments shown against all streams in Great Trent area">
            <p>Cold water segments shown against all streams show important fish habitats.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It is still perhaps possible to build a downstream trace tool for Experience Builder by creating a custom widget with 
            Developers tools, but this was not possible given the team experience and time available, and the constraints of the client 
            AGOL account version which does not support trace networks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Phase 3: Visualization</h2>
    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Client wanted a dark theme background on their static map.</li>
            <li>Static map was to be 3' x 4' size, and there are not many printing resources available to print poster quality images
            in this size.</li>
            <li>Content created for the dynamic map was created using the Fleming AGOL account before we were aware that the account 
            licensing forbids moving any material to any outside account, so the maps all needed to be rebuilt in NCC AGOL.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Created 4 Static Map files for printing: 2' x 3' with colour optimized for print, 2' x 3' with colour uptimized for digital
            3' x 4' with colour optimized for print and 3' x 4' with colour optimized for digital.  This allows the NCC to print a smaller
            version if necessary to get the desired print quality form local resources, and also to have digital version to share if desired.</li>

            <p>Static Map prepared for 3' x 4' print with dark background and streams visualized by Strahler stream order.</p>
            <li>Custom Web Experience on AGOL contains dynamic map with same background and thematic symbology as well as views for 
            specific focal areas.</li>
            <img src="images/ExperienceImage.jpg" alt="Online Experience web map of Area Of Interest with identical symbology to print map">
            <p>Map of Area Of Interest from Web App with same colours and symbology as print map</p>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Colours on printed material vary from one printer to another, or even with their current ink loads, so it would be 
            helpful for a print job like this to sample smaller sized versions at various printing options.  The Team did several
            test prints at 8.5 x 11 from Staples to determine if they were a viable options for the client, and they print well up to
            2' x 3', but print quality is poor above that size, so online printers may be the best option.</li>
