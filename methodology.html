        <h2>Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing</h2>
    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>High resolution elevation data is expensive or incomplete.</li>
            <img src="HighResDataFootprints.jpg" alt="footprint of high res elevation data not covering Area of Interest">
            <li>High resolution aerial imagery data for model verificatin was also hard to find.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ontario GeoHub provided great elevation data in their Ontario Integrated Hydrology dataset,
            as well as cold water data in their Aquatic Resource Area data.</li>
            <li>Data was extracted by mask to the Area Of Interest and Projected to NAD 83 Ontario MNR Lambert.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Higher resolution elevation data would yield more reliable results.  NRCAN Geogratis data 
            has a resource with 1 metre elevation data but it is not currently complete over the Area Of Interest but this 
            data set could be revisited at a later date to update the model created in this study.</li>

        <h2>Phase 2: Spatial Analysis</h2>
    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Though we had hoped to include our Trace Downstream and Trace Upstream tools in the delivered Experience
            it was found that the NCC AGOL account does not allow the use of trace networks, and no way was found to
            replicate this functionality with the tools available, so it was left as desktop only.</li>
            <li>Experience Builder was a steep learning curve with a tricky to use interface (ie. feature view widget overrides
                initial map view settings)
            </li>
            <li>StoryMaps didn't provide enough functionality and is optimized for multi-media and static content, which was not
                the focus of the solution
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Experience Builder contains a lot of useful functionality but requires a significant amount of time to learn</li>
            <li>Sometimes using a "workaround" is easier than trying to get the widget to work in the indended manner (such
                as manipulating the original data instead of recoding a custom widget)</li>
            <li>The choice of the solution is directly dependent on the goal of the project</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dedicated more time to learning Exprience Builder</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Milestone 3.1: Development in ArcGIS Experience Builder</h2>
    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Showing stream interconnectivity was difficult to do using the configurable widgets</li>
            <li>Group editing was not possible on Experience Builder (group members could not be editing the same Web Experience at once)</li>
            <li>Dynamic text is difficult to link to the appropriate data source</li>
            <li>Using views was difficult, but were required to overcome challenges of widgets re-setting initial view</li>
            <li>Difficulty in distinguishing format options between Maps, Views, and Pages</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Created multiple prototype proof-of-concept Experiences utilizing different widgets to display different properties
                of the data</li>
            <li>Possible to create a webpage-style application in Experience Builder</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Decide which approaches best fit the goals of the problem statement</li>

        <h2>Milestone 3.2: Download Developer Edition</h2>
    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Downloading Developer Edition was time consuming and required the download of Node.js, ArcGIS Experience Builder
                Developer Package (requires running multiple programs from the Command Prompt)</li>
            <li>Every usage requires starting the client and server services from Command Prompt</li>
            <li>To authenticate the application, new credentials had to be created in a ArcGIS Developers account</li>
            <li>To make custom widgets it is necessary to learn TypeScript and React which are ESRI specific languages</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Getting ArcGIS Experience Builder Developer Edition started on a local computer is time-consuming
                (valuable time taken away from working on the actual project)</li>
            <li>The learning curve for create custom widgets is extremely high and should be avoided if possible</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Return to Experience Builder to focus on configuring the "off-the-shelf" widgets</li>

    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Meeting Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Recommended using ArcGIS Hub to create a website to embed the Experience Builder solutions and create a webpage-style application</li>
            <li>Encouraged the manipulation of data instead of configuring the widget</li>

        <h2>Milestone 4.2: Introduction to ArcGIS Hub</h2>
    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Default template contained a lot of features that were not necessary (subtractive rather than additive templates)</li>
            <li>Challenging to change page formatting</li>
            <li>Easy to lose changes when switching to Preview Mode</li>
            <li>Difficult to find ArcGIS Hub in AGOL account as it creates a new folder upon creation</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ArcGIS Hub is a viable option for combining static and dynamic ESRI content (Web Maps, Experiences) in a 
                presentation-ready format</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Each group member created an ArcGIS Hub website to embed the Experiences</li>

        <h3 class="title-left">Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One ArcGIS Hub was selected to embed the Experiences along with explanatory text and web maps to support the 
                problem statement</li>

        <h3 class="title-left">Future Improvements</h3>
