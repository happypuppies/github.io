            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Headwater streams are critically important to the conservation efforts of the Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC) in the Rice Lake Plains 
            and Lake Iroquois Plain area and consist of ephemeral and intermittent streams as well as streams with permanent surface flow. The purpose 
            of this study was to create and visualize a network of all the headwater streams in this region. This study created hydrological models of 
            the regionâ€™s watercourses and used these to map headwater areas for the NCC in both static and dynamic maps to aid in their conservation work. 
            Enhanced Flow Direction Grid data was used to build a stream network attributed by Strahler stream order using a model constructed in ArcGIS Pro 2.7 
            with Arc Hydro tools. To visualize the depth of detailed information about surface runoff flow direction required by the NCC, a stream threshold 
            value of 150 was used, which captures areas where runoff can accumulate even if there is no permanent surface water present.  
            This stream network was used to create a series of static maps to be used primarily for print, but with versions colour-adjusted for digital 
            use as well.  Tools were constructed in ArcGIS Pro 2.7 to be used with the map data on a desktop utilizing ArcGIS Pro that allow a user to 
            place a point at either the start of a headwater, or an outflow point on a major stream, and the tools will select either all connected 
            downstream, or upstream segments respectively. A dynamic map was constructed using ArcGIS Online Experience Builder to visualize stream 
            segments by Strahler stream order as well as by segments of Cold Water within the entire region and by specific focal areas defined by the NCC. 
            Though all of these deliverables were of high quality and sufficient for the needs of this study, it is recommended that this study be repeated 
            with higher-resolution base data when such data becomes available for the region. </p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <h3>Ideal</h3>
        <p>A web app that provides stream order and background about the Rice Lake Plains - Lake Iroquois Plains Natural Area.</p>
        <h3>Reality</h3>
        <p>Rice Lake Plains - Lake Iroquois Plains Natural Area has no mapped headwater streams.</p>
        <h3>Consequences</h3>
        <p>Without headwater stream mapping, it is difficult to identify and prioritize areas for protections.</p>
        <h3>Proposal</h3>
        <p>Create a web app showing streams geographically bounded to the Rice Lake Plains - Lake Iroquois Plains Natural Area and Strahler stream order information.</p>
        <h3>Technology Used</h3>
        <p>ArcGIS Experience Builder, ArcGIS Hub, ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online</p>
